# Mercury
Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. It takes 87.97 Earth days to orbit the Sun, the shortest of all the Sun's planets. It is named after the Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), the messenger of the gods.  At twilight it may appear as a bright star-like object that can be seen by the naked eye, though it can be difficult to observe.

Mercury's surface appears heavily cratered and is similar in appearance to the Moon's. It has almost no atmosphere to retain heat, so its surface day temperatures vary more than on any other planet in the Solar System. Its temperatures can range from −280 °F at night to 800 °F during the day! Mercury has no moon.

# Venus
Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. It is the brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon; on rare occasions it is even visible to the naked eye in broad daylight.Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days. Venus does not have any moons.

Even though Mercury is closer to the Sun, Venus has the hottest surface of any planet in the Solar System. It has an average temperature is 867 °F and its clouds are made of sulfuric acid.

Venus has been a big inspiration for writers and poets as the "morning star" and "evening star". It was even the first planet to have its motions plotted across the sky!



# Earth
Earth is the third planet from the Sun. It is the only planet known to harbor and support life. About 30% of Earth's surface is land and 70% is water. Much of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice. Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. Severe weather, such as tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, and heatwaves, occurs in most areas and greatly impacts life.

Earth's gravity interacts with the Moon causing tides. Earth orbits around the Sun in about 365 days. Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest and most massive of the four rocky planets. Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago. Almost 8 billion humans live on Earth and depend on its natural resources for their survival.

# Mars
Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. It is the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, and is larger than only Mercury. Mars is named after the Roman god of war. It is often referred to as the "Red Planet" because it appears red due to the iron oxide on its surface. Mars can easily be seen from Earth with the naked eye, as can its reddish coloring. Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System. It is also the site of the Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos.

# Pluto
Pluto is the ninth object from the Sun, and is called a dwarf planet instead of a planet. It is named after the Roman god of the underworld. Pluto is made of ice and rock and is relatively small; it is one-sixth the mass of the Moon and one-third its volume. Pluto is so far away that light from the Sun takes 5.5 hours to reach it! Pluto has five known moons: Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra.
