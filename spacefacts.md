# Mercury
Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. It takes 87.97 Earth days to orbit the Sun, the shortest of all the Sun's planets. It is named after the Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), the messenger of the gods.  At twilight it may appear as a bright star-like object that can be seen by the naked eye, though it can be difficult to observe.

Mercury's surface appears heavily cratered and is similar in appearance to the Moon's. It has almost no atmosphere to retain heat, so its surface day temperatures vary more than on any other planet in the Solar System. Its temperatures can range from −280 °F at night to 800 °F during the day! Mercury has no moon.

Earth is the third planet from the Sun. It is the only planet known to harbor and support life. About 30% of Earth's surface is land and 70% is water. Much of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice. Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. Severe weather, such as tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, and heatwaves, occurs in most areas and greatly impacts life.

Earth's gravity interacts with the Moon causing tides. Earth orbits around the Sun in about 365 days. Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest and most massive of the four rocky planets. Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago. Almost 8 billion humans live on Earth and depend on its natural resources for their survival.
