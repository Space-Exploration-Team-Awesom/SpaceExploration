At twilight it may appear as a bright star-like object that can be seen by the naked eye, though it can be difficult to observe. Mercury's surface appears heavily cratered and is similar in appearance to the Moon's. It has almost no atmosphere to retain heat, so its surface day temperatures vary more than on any other planet in the Solar System. Its temperatures can range from −280 °F at night to 800 °F during the day! Mercury has no moon."],["Question 2 If Earth is the 3rd planet away from the Sun, what position is Mercury?", "Question 3 What astronomical body does Mercury most look like?"]);

It is the brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon; on rare occasions it is even visible to the naked eye in broad daylight. Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days. Venus does not have any moons. Even though Mercury is closer to the Sun, Venus has the hottest surface of any planet in the Solar System. It has an average temperature of 867 °F and its clouds are made of sulfuric acid. Venus has been a big inspiration for writers and poets as the "morning star" and "evening star". It was even the first planet to have its motions plotted across the sky!`],[ "We're going to need some quiz code for multiple choice and text input (using forms and buttons)"]);

Much of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice. Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. Severe weather, such as tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, and heatwaves, occurs in most areas and greatly impacts life.

  Earth's gravity interacts with the Moon causing tides. Earth orbits around the Sun in about 365 days. Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest and most massive of the four rocky planets. Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago.

Mars can easily be seen from Earth with the naked eye, as can its reddish coloring. Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System.
